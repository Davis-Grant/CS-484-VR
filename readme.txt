Name of application: Break Room
Group number: 18

Description: This project was designed to enable players to relieve stress by breaking objects without restrictions. It was based off real “Rage Rooms”, where paying customers are able to smash objects around a room. We hope to achieve that same effect within a VR experience avoiding the costs and safety risks involved.

How to play:
Using the grip controllers, a player can press the grip to teleport where the raycast turns white in the main scene. Similarly, grabbing objects can be performed with the grip when the raycast is white. The player camera is controlled via the head controller.

Objective:
After loading, the player must destroyed 9 or more objects in the main room to proceed to the victory screen.

Required technology:
Oculus Quest 2
Two grip controllers

Scene organization:
Three main scenes comprise this project. The first is a loading or title screen which proceeds after five seconds. Afterwards is the main destruction room, followed by a calm forest scene after victory.

Script organization:
All main scripts are in the primary script folder, while supplementary or unused scripts are in their appropriate sub menus.

Known issues or setbacks:
As of last testing, there were no particular issues functioning outside of our plans. For setbacks, we had to rein in out design to fit the difficulties of unity development. Destruction of objects had to be changed to explosions as normal destruction would require modeling destroyed objects and the appropriate textures. This would be far too complicated for the scope of our project. Additionally, getting working buttons in VR was difficult so we changed the title screen to load automatically after a few seconds versus pressing a button.
